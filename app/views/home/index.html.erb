<p ><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> To let SparkCognition sales, customer success, and any employee who uses SparkCognition products or speaks to potential prospects and current customers, provide field feedback from internal use, demos and prospect evaluations of products like Darwin, DeepNLP, SparkPredict, and DeepArmor.</p>

<p >SparkCognition employees can 'upvote' or <span class="oi oi-thumb-up" title="Thumbs Up" aria-hidden="true"></span> feedback to surface trends and patterns, with less bias or noise from specific users.</p>

<p>Product Managers and Leadership can use and download this feedback in csv format to pull into Excel or other tools.</p>  

<p>As feedback get resolved, Posters, Product Managers and Leadership can update the Post status from 'Active' to 'Resolved' so they no longer appear in the default view.  They can also update a notes field to explain what was done with the idea in the Post.</p>

<p><strong>GETTING STARTED:</strong> You can read and download feedback without logging in but to add and rank feedback, you must log in.  You can filter and sort results by most voted, posts resolved, all posts, product, or most recently added.</p>
