<p ><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> To let SparkCognition sales provide field feedback from demos and prospect evaluations of products like Darwin, DeepNLP, SparkPredict, and DeepArmor.</p>

<p >Sales can 'upvote' feedback to surface trends and patterns.  Product management and leadership can use and download this feedback.</p>

<p >As Posts get resolved, Posters and Administrators can update the Post status from 'Active' to 'Resolved' so they no longer appear in the default view.  A notes field will explain what was done with the idea in the Post.</p>

<p >This app will let users up vote <span class="oi oi-thumb-up" title="Thumbs Up" aria-hidden="true"></span> topics.  <%= link_to "All Feedback Posts", posts_path %></p>
